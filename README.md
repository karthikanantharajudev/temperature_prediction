# temperature_prediction
This project uses linear regression model to predict temperature

This project contains data in weather_data.csv file

This project contains two files: 1.read_data.ipynb and 2.linear_regression.ipynb

In read_data.ipynb, we consider one single variable humidity and try to determine its relationship with temperature and from observations, we find that humidity is inversely proportional to temperature.

In linear_regression.ipynb, we use sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression model to train and test the model with given dataset. After testing the model, we find cost of the model to be greater than 6.
